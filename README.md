Thanks for looking at my test project.
Please Note that this is my first React project and it is still just a test. CSS is a placeholder and only three Advantages and Disadvantages have been added, the final amount will be closer to fifty of each.
I hope to learn from this project the fundamentals of React and in particular how to organise components well.

Gurps Character Cheatsheet Maker

I have made this app to allow the players of a RPG I run to easily access clear descriptions of the Advantages and Disadvantages they have chosen for their character.

My main aims are:
That it is very quick and easy for the players to create it(as any GM knows, players are a lazy bunch).

Users can download a clear PDF of their choices thats is nicely formatted and easy to read.

After downloading it is easy for Users to access it on all their devices.

As the layout of how the advantages and disadvantages can vary a lot in the book I also tried to make presenting it as customisable for the programer writing the objects as possible.
